abstract: 'Recent genetic studies have identified variants associated with bipolar
  disorder (BD), but it remains unclear how brain gene expression is altered in BD
  and how genetic risk for BD may contribute to these alterations. Here, we obtained
  transcriptomes from subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala samples from
  post-mortem brains of individuals with BD and neurotypical controls, including 511
  total samples from 295 unique donors. We examined differential gene expression between
  cases and controls and the transcriptional effects of BD-associated genetic variants.
  We found two coexpressed modules that were associated with transcriptional changes
  in BD: one enriched for immune and inflammatory genes and the other with genes related
  to the postsynaptic membrane. Over 50% of BD genome-wide significant loci contained
  significant expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) (eQTL), and these data converged
  on several individual genes, including SCN2A and GRIN2A. Thus, these data implicate
  specific genes and pathways that may contribute to the pathology of BD.'
