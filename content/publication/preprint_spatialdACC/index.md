abstract: "In the human brain, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays key roles in various components of cognitive control, and is particularly relevant for reward processing and conflict monitoring. The dACC regulates expression of fear and pain, and its dysfunction is implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Compared to more recently specialized neocortical areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the dACC is evolutionarily older. The region's agranular structure, and other evolutionary specializations, such as the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs), contribute to its specialized roles in cognitive and emotional processing. Here, we generated paired spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from adjacent tissue sections of the dACC in ten adult neurotypical donors to define molecular profiles for dACC cell types and spatial domains. Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), we integrated these data by identifying gene expression patterns within the snRNA-seq data, which were projected onto the SRT data to infer the spatial localization. Combining these data with publicly available resources, we revealed insights about molecular profiles, spatial topography, enrichment of disease risk, and putative connectivity of spatially-localized dACC cell types, including VENs. Utilizing published dlPFC snRNA-seq and SRT data collected in the same neurotypical brain donors used here, we deployed cross-region comparison analyses between dACC and dlPFC to understand spatio-molecular specializations and laminar organization across human brain evolution. To make this comprehensive molecular resource accessible to the scientific community, we made both raw and processed data freely available, including through interactive web applications."
