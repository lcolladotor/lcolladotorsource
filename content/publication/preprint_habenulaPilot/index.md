abstract: "Pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SCZD), is linked to habenula (Hb) function. While pharmacotherapies and deep brain stimulation targeting the Hb are emerging as promising therapeutic treatments, little is known about the cell type-specific transcriptomic organization of the human Hb or how it is altered in SCZD. Here we define the molecular neuroanatomy of the human Hb and identify transcriptomic changes in individuals with SCZD compared to neurotypical controls. Utilizing Hb-enriched postmortem human brain tissue, we performed single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq; n=7 neurotypical donors) and identified 17 molecularly defined Hb cell types across 16,437 nuclei, including 3 medial and 7 lateral Hb populations, several of which were conserved between rodents and humans. Single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH; n=3 neurotypical donors) validated snRNA-seq Hb cell types and mapped their spatial locations. Bulk RNA-sequencing and cell type deconvolution in Hb-enriched tissue from 35 individuals with SCZD and 33 neurotypical controls yielded 45 SCZD-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs, FDR < 0.05), with 32 (71%) unique to Hb-enriched tissue. eQTL analysis identified 717 independent SNP-gene pairs (FDR < 0.05), where either the SNP is a SCZD risk variant (16 pairs) or the gene is a SCZD DEG (7 pairs). eQTL and SCZD risk colocalization analysis identified 16 colocalized genes. These results identify topographically organized cell types with distinct molecular signatures in the human Hb and demonstrate unique genetic changes associated with SCZD, thereby providing novel molecular insights into the role of Hb in neuropsychiatric disorders."
