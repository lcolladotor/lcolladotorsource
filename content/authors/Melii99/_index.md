From Melissa:

> I am an undergraduate student in Genomic Sciences program at LCG-UNAM. My research interests lean towards in developmental biology, transcriptomics, epigenetics and ML. Currently I´m an apprentice and a new member of Leonardo Collado's laboratory at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development.
