![](http://ghchart.rshah.org/DA2536/lcolladotor.svg)

At the Lieber Institute for Brain Development ([LIBD](https://www.libd.org/)), I lead the [**R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science**](https://lcolladotor.github.io/#about) group. I am also an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostastics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Additionally, I am interested in outreach activities as a board member of the [Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/#people). 

As a quick background, I graduated from the [Undergraduate Program on Genomic Sciences](http://www.lcg.unam.mx/about) from the National Autonomous University of Mexico ([UNAM](http://unam.mx/)) in 2009 and worked for two years at Winter Genomics analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. I then got a PhD in 2016 from the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) thanks to a [CONACyT scholarship](http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/). There I worked with [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) and [Andrew Jaffe](http://aejaffe.com/) in developing [derfinder](http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder) and [recount](http://bioconductor.org/packages/recount). I then worked ~ 4 years as a Staff Scientist and Research Scientist in Andrew Jaffe's lab on a variety of data analysis projects. I became a principal investigator in September 2020.

Every day I use [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/), and on some days I [write R packages](https://lcolladotor.github.io/pkgs/). Occasionally I write [blog posts](http://lcolladotor.github.io/#blog) about them and other tools. I'm a co-founder of the [LIBD rstats club](http://LieberInstitute.github.io/rstatsclub/) and the [CDSB community](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io) of R and Bioconductor developers in Mexico and Latin America, that we described at the [R Consortium website](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2020/03/18/cdsb-diversity-and-outreach-hotspot-in-mexico). In the past, I also served on the [Bioconductor Community Advisory Board](http://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/) and the advisory board for [rOpenSciâ€™s Statistical Software Peer Review](https://ropensci.org/stat-software-review/).
