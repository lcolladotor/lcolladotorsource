At the Lieber Institute for Brain Development ([LIBD](https://www.libd.org/)), I lead the [**R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science**](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/) group that works on understanding the roots and signatures of disease (particularly psychiatric disorders) by zooming in across dimensions of gene activity. We achieve this by studying gene expression at all expression feature levels (genes, exons, exon-exon junctions, and un-annotated regions) and by using different gene expression measurement technologies (bulk RNA-seq, single cell/nuclei RNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics) that provide finer biological resolution and localization of gene expression. My group works closely with collaborators from LIBD as well as from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) which reflects the cross-disciplinary approach and diversity in expertise needed to further advance our understanding of high throughput biology. I am also interested in outreach activities as member of the [Bioconductor Community Advisory Board](http://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/), the advisory board for [rOpenSci’s Statistical Software Peer Review](https://ropensci.org/stat-software-review/), and the board of the [Community of Bioinformatics Software Developers](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io/#people) in Mexico. In order to provide a supportive and stimulating research environment the team is involved in [career planning](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/career-growth.html), [internal training opportunities](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/rbioconductor-data-science-bootcamps.html), [Data Science guidance sessions](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/data-science-guidance-sessions.html), the [LIBD rstats club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/#.YEvDq2RKgdk), among other initiatives.

As a quick background, I graduated from the [Undergraduate Program on Genomic Sciences](http://www.lcg.unam.mx/about) from the National Autonomous University of Mexico ([UNAM](http://unam.mx/)) in 2009 and worked for two years at Winter Genomics analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. I then got a PhD in 2016 from the [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](http://www.jhsph.edu/) thanks to a [CONACyT scholarship](http://www.conacyt.gob.mx/). There I worked with [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) and [Andrew Jaffe](http://aejaffe.com/) in developing [derfinder](http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder) and [recount](http://bioconductor.org/packages/recount). I then worked ~ 4 years as a Staff Scientist and Research Scientist in Andrew Jaffe's lab on a variety of data analysis projects.

Every day I use [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/), and on some days I [write R packages](https://lcolladotor.github.io/pkgs/). Occasionally I write [blog posts](http://lcolladotor.github.io/#blog) about them and other tools. I'm a co-founder of the [LIBD rstats club](http://LieberInstitute.github.io/rstatsclub/) and the [CDSB community](https://comunidadbioinfo.github.io) of R and Bioconductor developers in Mexico and Latin America, that we described at the [R Consortium website](https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2020/03/18/cdsb-diversity-and-outreach-hotspot-in-mexico).

If you want to join my team, please check the [LIBD career opportunities](https://www.libd.org/careers/)!  ^_^ 💪🏽🇲🇽

Here are the videos of some of my talks, though I have plenty more videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/LeonardoColladoTorres/playlists).
