At the Lieber Institute for Brain Development ([LIBD](https://www.libd.org/)), our group works on understanding the roots and signatures of disease (particularly psychiatric disorders) by zooming in across dimensions of gene activity. We achieve this by studying gene expression at all expression feature levels (genes, exons, exon-exon junctions, and un-annotated regions) and by using different gene expression measurement technologies (bulk RNA-seq, single cell/nucleus RNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics) that provide finer biological resolution and localization of gene expression. We work closely with collaborators from LIBD as well as from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and other institutions, which reflects the cross-disciplinary approach and diversity in expertise needed to further advance our understanding of high throughput biology.

In order to provide a supportive and stimulating research environment at LIBD, our group provides [Data Science guidance sessions](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/data-science-guidance-sessions.html) open to any LIBD staff member and we organize the [LIBD rstats club](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/#.YEvDq2RKgdk), among other initiatives. Our [documentation book website](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds) contains more details for on boarding, how to ask for help, bootcamps, writing papers, authorship, configuration files, and much more.

We constantly create new content to share what we are learning or working on, which you might be interested in. In particular, we:

* run the LIBD rstats club: [**rstats club schedule**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1is8dZSd0FZ9Qi1Zvq1uRhm-P1McnJRd_zxdAfCRoMfA/edit?usp=sharing)
* discuss papers and software in our team meetings: [**team meeting schedule**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r6552ySisg7_KpmJmChOvLHVWdMmss3bncEf2jqIM9k/edit?usp=sharing)

## Join the team

If you are interested in joining the **R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science** group, please check our open positions at the [LIBD career opportunities website](https://www.libd.org/careers/). You might be interested in checking our [anonymous team survey results](https://lcolladotor.github.io/team_surveys/), which highlights some strengths but also some weaknesses and areas we can improve.

If we don't have any open positions, please reach out to Leonardo with your CV, GitHub/GitLab/etc profile with open-source software, and a short description of why you are interested in our team.
