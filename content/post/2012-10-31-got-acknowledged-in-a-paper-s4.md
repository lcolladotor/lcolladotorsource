title: Got acknowledged in a paper ^^

---

<p>During the weekend while I was talking with a friend and former colleague, I realized that my name was mentioned in the acknowledgments section of a paper :) I haven&#8217;t been much in touch with what&#8217;s been happening back home, so this was a nice surprise.</p>
<p>The paper is:Â <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/385">Genetic changes during a laboratory adaptive evolution process that allowed fast growth in glucose to an <em>Escherichia coli</em> strain lacking the major glucose transport system</a> by Aguilar<em> et al</em>. It was published in BMC Genomics in 2012.</p>
