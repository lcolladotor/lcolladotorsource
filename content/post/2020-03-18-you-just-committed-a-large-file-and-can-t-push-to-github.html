<p>{{% callout note %}}
Oh ohh! 😱 What do you do now?
{{% /callout %}}</p>
<p>The data me and my colleagues work with is typically too big for our personal computers, so we use a high performance computing environment (cluster) and mostly interact with it through the command line terminal. As you might know, I’m a big fan of version control and I use <a href="https://git-scm.com/"><code>git</code></a> plus <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for sharing our code <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. That’s why I’ve been advocating others to use it for a while and when they do, they run to me if they have some issues. A while back, my former student <a href="/authors/apeterson/">Amy Peterson</a> wrote a blog post titled <a href="http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/post/git-to-know-git/">git to know git: an 8 minute introduction</a> which is useful if you are getting started. Amy also links to the excellent <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/">Happy Git and GitHub for the useR</a> book.</p>
<div id="recurrent-problem-you-just-commited-a-large-file-and-cant-push-to-github" class="section level3">
<h3>Recurrent problem: you just commited a large file and can’t push to GitHub</h3>
<p>One situation that I’ve frequently helped others with is when they use <code>git add *</code> or <code>git add .</code> and version control <em>every</em> file in their project. They then do a commit such as <code>git commit -m "added all files"</code> and run <code>git push</code> to sync their files to GitHub. But oops, GitHub complains that you are trying to commit files larger than 50 Mb and even grinds to a halt if they are larger than 100 Mb. Which given that we work with large data, happens frequently (even a PDF file can be that big!).</p>
<p>Ok, so what can you do at this point? Remember, this is the scenario where you <strong>just</strong> made that commit. That is, it’s the last commit. At that point, it’s best to <em>undo your last git commit</em> which is well described in <a href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/undo-last-commit">this website</a>. However, when you <em>undo</em> a commit, you can either fully wipe out any changes (wipe them out fully from your disk, not only <code>git</code>’s version control!) or undo the version control step but also keep your files intact. The main solution then is to use:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1</code></pre>
<p>However, maybe you tried other commands and it’s a bit more complicated than that. Which is why I greatly advise that you create a local backup of your <code>main_project</code> directory before you dive into commands such as <code>git reset</code>, specially whenever you see the <code>--hard</code> option being suggested. That is, do something like this:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>## Nagivate to the parent directory of your main_project
cd directory_containing_your_project

## Check the full size of your project directory
du -sh main_project

## Do you have enough disk space?
df -h .

## If you have enough disk space, then create a full backup
cp -r main_project main_project_backup/</code></pre>
<p>Once you are able to roll back the offending commit, instead of running <code>git add *</code> or <code>git add .</code> and similar commands, repeat the following cycle:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Check which files are not being version controlled (untracked) with <code>git status</code>.</li>
<li>Check how big each of your untracked files is. You can do so with <code>ls -lh</code> and <code>ls -lh some_pattern</code>.</li>
<li>Add the files or file patterns you want to avoid version controlling (the large files) to your <code>.gitignore</code> file <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Double check that your pattern worked by confirming that these files do not show up as <em>untracked</em> when you run <code>git status</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat this until the only remaining untracked files are those you actually want to version control and that are small enough <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>And that’s it! Keep version controlling your code and reap the benefits later on when you need to.</p>

</p>
<p>We all run into this situation at some point (or multiple times), so please keep using version control. The benefits will outweigh the negatives!</p>

<h3>Use case story: the issue</h3>
<p>Thanks to a colleague who gave me permission to share their use case, here we can dive down into a real life example. First, this was their description (edited for anonymity):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ran these, as per GitHub’s instructions, and it went fine</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="bash"><code>git init
git add README.md
git commit -m &quot;first commit&quot;
git remote add origin git@github.com:LieberInstitute/some_repository.git
git push -u origin master</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Even added a <code>.gitignore</code> with some instructions on what to ignore when committing</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But it wasn’t enough and I hadn’t come to appreciate yet that there’s no need to commit <code>.rda</code>’s or other very large files, so my <code>git push</code> died.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since these were already staged, I thought the next move was to make another commit with an edited <code>.gitignore</code> listing anything in my <code>rdas/</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Putting me two branches ahead of master (Leo: commits I think)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I got frustrated and thought then that ok, I want to go back two commits…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>my Googling suggested me to go for <code>git reset --hard HEAD~2</code>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s when I started panicking 😭</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My colleague started panicking at this point because they couldn’t see the files anymore. That is, running <code>ls -lh rdas/</code> didn’t list the files they had worked on really hard to create over the past months. But at this point, these large files were under version control by <code>git</code> <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, just not available on <code>GitHub</code> due to the file size limitations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So then my panic Googling took me to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5788037/recover-from-git-reset-hard" class="uri">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5788037/recover-from-git-reset-hard</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>where I thought ok I just can run <code>git reset HEAD@{2}</code> , which was</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="bash"><code>7cb9bac HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD@{2}
1e8499d HEAD@{1}: reset: moving to HEAD~2
f03b884 HEAD@{2}: commit: Committing EVERYTHING
7cb9bac HEAD@{3}: commit: Commiting EVERYTHING          &lt;- this one
1e8499d HEAD@{4}: commit (initial): first commit</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>And there it looked like not everything was quite lost, as I could see</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ git status
# On branch master
# Your branch is ahead of &#39;origin/master&#39; by 1 commit.
#   (use &quot;git push&quot; to publish your local commits)
#
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use &quot;git add/rm &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)

#   rdas/*other*.rda
#   *other*.R
no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>So now my colleague realizes that somehow <code>git</code> is version controlling the files, but the <code>deleted</code> label is still VERY scary!!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And then I thought ok I just need to re-stage those deleted files…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So I ran <code>git add -A</code> , but now I see</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ git status
# On branch master

<blockquote>
<p>and clearly I don’t know what I’m doing so I stopped</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And thanked the lord you were online. 😭😭</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I promise I did some reviewing of resources and testing with local and JHPCE test dirs before</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My colleague then pointed me to the directory with the files and we fixed their files.</p>
</div>
<div id="use-case-story-the-solution" class="section level3">
<h3>Use case story: the solution</h3>
<p>Like I mentioned earlier, the first thing to do in cases like this is to create a backup.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>## Check how big it is
du -sh project_FINAL

## Create a backup
cp -r project_FINAL project_leo_backup/

## To wipe out the original copy
## proceed with EXTREME caution!
# rm -fr project_FINAL

## Then restore everything from your backup copy
cp -r project_leo_backup project_FINAL/</code></pre>
<p>I actually messed up at one point and had to rely on this backup!! So, like I said,</p>
<p>{{% callout note %}}
Please backup everything before you start using <code>git reset</code> and similar commands!
{{% /callout %}}</p>
<p>Next, to undo all the <code>git rm</code> (deleting a file), I undid the <code>git add -A</code> step using a combination of <code>git reset</code> and <code>git checkout</code> (to restore files).</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># https://stackoverflow.com/a/2125713/9374370
$ git reset HEAD
$ git checkout .

## check things
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of &#39;origin/master&#39; by 1 commit.

    first commit

$ ls -lh rdas
total 6.2G
## I see tons of stuff (many of which I&#39;m now the &quot;owner&quot; of)</code></pre>
<p>I then finally used <code>git reset --soft</code> to undo the last commit.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/undo-last-commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1 ## note that I&#39;m not using --hard

## Everything is back to before that big commit
$ git log

Date:   Tue Mar 17 19:04:03 2020 -0400
    first commit

## and the files are there =)
$ ls -lh rdas
total 6.2G
-rwxrwx--- 1 lcollado lieber_jaffe 690M Mar 18 00:22 *.rda ## exmaple file</code></pre>
<p>Now that the directory and files have been restored to before all files were committed, we can proceed to ignore large files. For example, we can ignore the <code>rdas/</code> directory that has many large files that we don’t want to version control <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>$ git status

    modified:   README.md

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
    .RData
    .gitignore
    *.R ## Lots of files with this pattern
    *.sh ## Lots of files with this pattern
    pdfs/
    rdas/
    tables/
