## PDCB

While working at Winter Genomics I taught two courses for students of the Biomedical Sciences PhD Program (PDCB) from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).

1. [Analysis of High-Throughput Sequencing data with Bioconductor](http://lcolladotor.github.io/courses/PDCB-HTS.html) Aug-Dec 2010.
1. [Introduction to R and Biostatistics](http://lcolladotor.github.io/courses/PDCB-Biostats.html) (along with two other teachers).

## IBT

While I was at the Institute of Biotechnology (UNAM) working with the Winter Genomics crew I organized two courses. One was a series of various bioinformatics and biology mini-courses and another one involved members of different academic institutions.

1. [Introduction to R for bench biologists](http://lcolladotor.github.io/courses/mIntroR.html) Oct-Nov 2009. This mini-course has quite a bit of material on learning how to make plots with R.
1. [Statistical Methods and Analysis of Genomic Data](http://lcolladotor.github.io/courses/MEyAdDG.html) Jan 2010. This one week course had lectures about Perl, using a Cluster, high-throughput technologies, R and Bioconductor, C, and biology overviews.

## LCG

I taught three courses during my undergrad stage at the Undergraduate Program on Genomic Sciences (LCG). Each of these courses has its own website organizing the material. These are:

1. [Intensive course on R/Bioconductor](http://lcolladotor.github.io/courses/Courses/R/) Oct-Nov 2008
1. [Principles of Statistics](http://lcolladotor.github.io/courses/Courses/E/) Feb-June 2009
1. [Seminar III: R/Bioconductor](http://lcolladotor.github.io/courses/Courses/B/) Aug-Dec 2009
